### Hello! 👋

What is a Polyhobbyist? Well, it is someone who loves lots of hobbies. I’m a polyhobbyist, and you may be too! Professionally, I’m a Software Engineer where I work on ROS professionally, and I do robotics as a hobby – which means the fun never stops! 

You know what they say, “Do what you love and you never work a day in your life”… (I wish that were true; some days…)

Robotics is the ultimate intersection of disciplines – Electronics and Mechanics (mechatronics), Computer Vision and AI, Machining, modeling, 3d printing – and more.

I’ve been a “Maker” for most of my life, although the culture either didn’t have a name – or more specifically had too many names… But it was a culture I identified with. So much so, I was able to work professionally as a Maker. 

This website and associated youtube channel are hobbies as well.

I hope you enjoy what you see.
