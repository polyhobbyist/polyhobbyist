What is a Polyhobbyist? Well, it is someone who loves lots of hobbies. I’m a polyhobbyist, and you may be too! Professionally, I’m a Software Engineer at a large Software company outside of Seattle. I work in Robotics for work, and robotics as a hobby – which means the fun never stops!

You know what they say, “Do what you love and you never work a day in your life”… (I wish that were true; some days…)

Robotics is the ultimate intersection of disciplines – Electronics and Mechanics (mechatronics), Computer Vision and AI, Machining, modeling, 3d printing – and more.

I’ve been a “Maker” for most of my life, although the culture either didn’t have a name – or more specifically had too many names… But it was a culture I identified with. So much so, I was able to work professionally as a Maker. 

This website and associated youtube channel are hobbies as well. I’ve intended to do this for many years now, but found it hard to start… yet… another… hobby…

I'm also posting this content on [Odysee](https://odysee.com/) - a distributed alternative to Youtube.

I hope you enjoy what you see.
